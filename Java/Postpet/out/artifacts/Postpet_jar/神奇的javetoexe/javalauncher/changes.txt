Changes made to v1.22 sep 9th 2003
-----------------------------------------------
* Fixed bug in that caused launcher.cfg not to run
if the specified cfg file was not found.

Changes made to v1.21 nov 4th 2002
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed small bug (line 87 in the source) that could 
cause garbled error messages to be printed out. Thanks
to Dennis Brake for pointing this out.

Changes made to v1.20 jul 26th 2002
---------------------------------------------
* Added support multiple launcher.cfg files. Now the system
first looks for a file with the same extension as the .exe
file but with a .cfg extension instead. If it was not found
the regular launcher.cfg file will be used instead. This allows
several .exe files with different configurations to be placed
in the same directory - something that was impossible before.

Changes made to v1.11 jun 16th 2002
----------------------------------------------
* Added a description to an error message in readme.txt.
This description was forgotten when readme.txt was originally
written.

Changes made to v1.10 jan 25th 2002
----------------------------------------------

* Arguments passed to the exe will now be passed on to the java
program.
* Cleaned up some of the documentation and added a troubleshooting
section.
